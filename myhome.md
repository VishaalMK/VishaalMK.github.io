I'm a strategic consultant working in the Research and Analytics division of IBM. I'm strongly driven by the value that I can create for my clients by leveraging my expertise in Machine Learning.

Previously, I was a research associate working on [adversarial examples](https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/), at the intersection of Computer Vision and AI Safety, in [Dr. Anh Nguyen's](http://anhnguyen.me/research/) lab at Auburn University. I graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in 2017 with a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering.

## Research Motivation
My work on adversarial examples (a minuscule step) was driven by an interest in making machines understand our world as well as humans do, specifically in the visual domain. Additionally, I deeply reverberate with the efforts taken towards developing artificial intelligent systems that end up being __beneficial__ to human beings.
