The name is Vishaal Munusamy Kabilan. I'm currently an independent researcher looking for intersting ways to spend my life. End of the day, it is only through giving that I feel the most sated. So by being shamelessly selfish I'd like to carry out more of it.

## Research Interests

I'd done my Master's in robotics with nothing much to show for, mainly because my egotistic dream of making it big by writing _hugely_ profitable trading algorithms. I then settled aspiring a more serene goal of exploring science and hence did I land in deep learning. My work was on understadnng why deep learning models should not be anthropomorphised. Something fruitful turned out from this. Well, you can be the judge. Next up, I'm looking to break into AI Safety mainly because I feel
it's a low-hanging fruit that many people haven't paid much heed to.
